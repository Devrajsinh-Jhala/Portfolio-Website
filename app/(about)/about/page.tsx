          Hello! I am Devraj Jhala, a front end full stack developer hailing
          from India. I am currently a final year student pursuing a
          Bachelor&apos;s degree in Computer Science and Engineering. I have
          interned in various positions such as front end developer and full
          stack developer in startups and mid-sized companies. I really enjoy
          working with Next.js, Tailwind, TypeScript to build UI components and
          interfaces.
        </p>

        <p>
          My interest in web development started in my 2nd year of college when
          I built my first project - a simple portfolio website using HTML, CSS
          and JS which I must admit, I learned by watching and copying the code
          from YouTube tutorials!ðŸ˜….
        </p>

        <p>
          I soon realized that what I had learned so far was just a small
          fraction of the vast ocean of knowledge in the field. Motivated to
          expand my skill set, I delved into React, Redux, TypeScript, and API
          development. As a front-end developer, it was crucial for me to
          understand API management and work with databases like MySQL,
          PostgreSQL, and Firebase. Eventually, I discovered the power
          ofNext.js, and it revolutionized my approach to building and
          developing full-stack applications. The ease with which Next.js
          enables development is truly remarkable.
        </p>

        <p>
          Apart from all these, I really love to share my learning and hence I
          write blogs on Hashnode. Though not regularly but I try to ðŸ˜…. If you
          are reading this, I really appreciate your time in reading and giving
          me your valuable time. If you have any questions, feel free to reach
          out to me on LinkedIn or Twitter. Also if you want to check out my
          other projects, feel free to visit my GitHub.
